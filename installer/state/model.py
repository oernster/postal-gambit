"""What the setup program should offer, given what is already installed.

The snapshot is the single input the UI reads to decide its mode, its primary
action and the state of its options, so no widget queries the registry itself.
That is what makes the launch-at-sign-in checkbox reflect the machine rather
than a hardcoded default. State is detected from the bundled version passed in
rather than read here, which keeps this package free of any dependency on the
payload. British spelling is used in comments. No em dashes appear anywhere.
