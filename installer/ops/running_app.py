"""Detecting, closing and launching the installed application.

An install replaces every file in the bundle, so it must not run while the
application holds its own executable open. The setup program therefore detects a
running instance and offers to end it, rather than only telling the user to do
it themselves.

Ending it is a forced termination rather than a polite close request. Postal
Gambit intercepts a window close, so asking its window to close leaves the
process alive and the file still locked. British spelling is used in comments.
No em dashes appear anywhere.
