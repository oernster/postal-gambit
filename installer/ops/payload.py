"""The application bundle the setup program carries, and putting it on disk.

The bundle ships as a single zip because Nuitka's onefile build drops loose
executables and DLLs from an included data directory, so the installer extracts
the archive on deploy. Extraction is member by member rather than a single
``extractall``: it lets the operation report real progress, and it lets every
entry be checked before it is written. British spelling is used in comments. No
em dashes appear anywhere.
