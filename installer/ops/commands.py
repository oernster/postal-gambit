"""The single seam through which the installer shells out.

Every external command the installer runs (the task list, the forced close,
PowerShell for shortcuts and the deferred delete) goes through a
``CommandRunner``. Production code uses the real runner below; tests pass a
hand-written fake, so no test ever spawns a process it did not intend to.
British spelling is used in comments. No em dashes appear anywhere.
