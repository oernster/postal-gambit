"""Install, upgrade, reinstall and repair.

Every one of these is the same sequence: put the files down, register the
uninstaller, record the installation, point the postalgambit: scheme at the new
executable, then apply the user's options. Repair differs only in that it
re-deploys over an install that is already there, which without a per-file
manifest is the safe way to restore anything missing or altered. The user's
games and settings live outside the install directory, so they are never
touched. British spelling is used in comments. No em dashes appear anywhere.
