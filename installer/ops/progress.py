"""Progress reporting for the long-running installer operations.

An install replaces every file in the bundle and an uninstall removes them
again, so both report their phase and a percentage rather than freezing behind
a single status line. Extraction is by far the longest phase, so it is given a
span of its own to report within rather than a single milestone. The callback is
optional throughout: the operations are callable headlessly with no reporter
attached. British spelling is used in comments. No em dashes appear anywhere.
