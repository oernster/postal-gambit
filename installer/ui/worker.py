"""Running an installer operation off the UI thread.

Install, repair and uninstall all move tens of megabytes, so running them on the
UI thread froze the window for the whole operation and left the progress bar
unable to paint. Each runs on a worker thread instead and reports back through
signals, which is what replaced the single status line and its
QApplication.processEvents() nudge. British spelling is used in comments. No em
dashes appear anywhere.
