"""Offering to close a running application before the files are replaced.

Telling the user to go and close it themselves leaves them to find the window
and come back. Offering to do it is one click, so that is what is offered, with
the consequence stated plainly because the running session ends. British
spelling is used in comments. No em dashes appear anywhere.
