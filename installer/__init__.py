"""The Postal Gambit setup program.

A self-contained PySide6 installer, compiled into a single executable by
buildinstaller.py. The package is split so the privileged work is measurable:

- ``ops`` and ``state`` hold every side effect (payload extraction, shortcuts,
  registry writes, the postalgambit: URI registration, process control) and
  import no Qt, so they are unit tested and held at 100% coverage.
- ``ui`` holds the themed window and dialogs and is the only Qt client.
- ``app`` is the composition root, wiring the two together.

British spelling is used in comments. No em dashes appear anywhere.
