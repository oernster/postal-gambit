"""Locating the data the setup program carries.

The payload is anchored on the ``installer`` package directory rather than on
the running script, so one rule holds in both modes:

- from source, the package directory is ``<repo>/installer`` and the payload
  staged by buildinstaller.py sits at ``<repo>/installer/payload``;
- compiled, Nuitka reproduces the package layout under the unpacked root and
  buildinstaller.py includes the same data at ``installer/payload``.

Anchoring on ``__file__`` of the main script would not survive the entry point
moving, which is why the anchor is the package itself. British spelling is used
in comments. No em dashes appear anywhere.
